# JuSW-ESPH

JuSW-ESPH: A High-Performance Eulerian SPH Solver for Shallow Water Equations

JuSW-ESPH is a high-performance Eulerian Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) solver written in Julia, designed for accurate and efficient simulation of shallow water flows.

The code combines:

🚀 Multithreading (CPU) and CUDA acceleration (GPU)

🌊 An Eulerian SPH formulation for shallow water equations

🔀 A robust HLL Riemann solver

⚖️ A well-balanced scheme preserving steady states

⏱️ A simple, stable leap-frog time integration

JuSW-ESPH is built for speed, robustness, and clarity, making it suitable for research, benchmarking, and free-surface flow simulations.
